      <h1>The Vision's Paprikash</h1>
        <img src="../imgs/the-visions-paprikash_1.jpg" alt="Gorgeous bowl of red Paprikash" width="400">
        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p><em>The Vision</em> has little cooking experience, but nevertheless attempts to make this dish for Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch) to lift her spirits.</p>
          <p>Wanda notes in the film that "this is not paprika". I'm guessing the Vision accidentally used cayenne or chili powder instead of pure, sweet paprika.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 plum tomatoes</li>  
            <li>1 Italian frying pepper</li> 
            <li>1 yellow onion</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li> 
            <li>1 3-4lb. chicken</li> 
            <li>salt</li> 
            <li>pepper</li> 
            <li>3 tbsp Hungarian sweep paprika (+extra)</li> 
            <li>2 cups chicken stock</li> 
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li> 
          </ul> 
        <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Wash, then remove the stems and cores from the tomatoes and pepper. Seed tomatoes and pepper, and cut into 1-inch pieces. Mince onion.</li>   
            <li>Warm oil in a large, deep pot over medium-high heat. (Using a large pot and stirring with a ladle or long wooden spoon will keep oil from splashing on you. It will also let you cook the chicken all at once, rather than in batches.)</li> 
            <li>Add chicken to pot, seasoning as desired with salt and pepper.</li> 
            <li>Cook chicken until browned (about 8-10 minutes), using a long wooden spoon to stir. Transfer chicken to plate, and set aside.</li> 
            <li>Cook onion in pan and stir occasionally until soft (about 8 minutes).</li> 
            <li>Add paprika and stir (about 2 minutes). (Optional: use cayenne or chili powder instead of paprika. Then get confused about what garnish means, and add another pinch of the spice.)</li> 
            <li>Return chicken and its juices to the pan. Add stock, tomatoes, and pepper.</li> 
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer until chicken is cooked (about 30 minutes).</li> 
            <li>Ladle soup into bowls. Top with sour cream and another pinch of paprika.</li> 
            <li>Serve with rice, egg noodles, or dumplings.</li> 
          </ol>
