A basic recipe site with HTML for The Odin Project.

## Finishing Notes
First TOP assignment finished. Learned how to fill out HTML boilerplate from memory and use basic HTML elements. Can adequately make headers and paragraphs, as well as input links and images. Learned how to create unordered and ordered lists and use them in conjuction with other elements to create aesthetically pleasing text. Got some practice creating and navigating directories using CLI. One point of improvement for now will be to commit more often and with better more concise messages

## Additional Notes
Ran into an issue where the images weren't displaying on github page. Simple fix; I hadn't pushed the images to remote repository. Getting a grasp on when to commit and commit messages also. I struggled with that during this assignment but I think I'll do better on the next project.
